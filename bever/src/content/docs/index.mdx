## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/BlueGummi/belle
```


Cargo, RustC, GCC, and Makefile **compatibility must be present on the system** if these programs are to be installed.

Every executable in this repository can have the `--help` flag passed to display helpful information.


```
./build.sh -w && ./install.sh -c # This installs the binaries to ~/.local/bin on Unix OS's
```

Or, for Windows

```pwsh
.\build.ps1 -w && .\install.ps1 -c
```

The binaries can be run by calling `basm`, `belle`, or `bdump`.
