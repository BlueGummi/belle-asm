## Quickstart

If the build script **has not been executed yet**, run this.

```
cargo build --release
```

To **assemble source code**, execute this.

```
cargo run --release -- -o output source.asm
```

Or, **if the assembler has been installed**, run 
```
basm -o output source.asm
```
from any directory.

Different flags can be passed to make the assembler **emit different output**, but none will affect how it assembles code.

# Syntax

### Note:

It is recommended to read the [ISA documentation](https://github.com/BlueGummi/belle/tree/master/docs/isa) before delving into the documentation for the assembler. This document may be overly technical without prior knowledge of the ISA and assembly code.

## Instruction syntax

The BELLE assembler is mostly **case-agnostic**, as when data is parsed, it either gets **converted to upper or lowercase** for further processing.

All instructions will be formatted **instruction** destination, **source**.

```asm
    mov %r0, #4 ; this is valid
    mOv %R0, #4 ; this is also valid
    MOV %r0, #4 ; this is valid too
```

Different operands, depending on the type of operand, will have a **different prefixed symbol**.

| Symbol | Meaning | Description | Example |
| :----- | :------ | :------ | :------|
| `;`    | Comment | A comment in the code. All following data on the line is ignored by the assembler | `; This is a comment` | 
| `#`    | Literal | A literal value to be used as the source for an operation | `#4 ; Literal 4` |
| `%r`   | Register | A register to be used as the source or destination for an operation | `%r3 ; Register 3` | 
| `$`    | Memory address | A memory address to be used as the source or destination for an operation | `$400 ; Memory address 400` |
| `&r`   | Register pointer | A register that contains a memory address that can be accessed by treating the register as a pointer | `&r4 ; Treat the value in register 4 as a memory address and obtain the value at that memory address` | 
| `&$` | Memory address pointer | A memory address whose value is treated as a pointer | `&$10 ; Treat the value in memory address 10 as a pointer and obtain the value at the memory address` | 
| `@`  | Subroutine call | A symbol used to refer to the memory address of a subroutine later in the program | `@foo ; This is replaced with the memory address of the 'foo' subroutine at compile time` | 
| `.` | CPU directive | A one-time directive given to the CPU when the memory is loaded. Expanded upon later | `.ssp $40 ; Set stack pointer to memory address 40` |

As with operands, symbols for registers are also case-agnostic. However, subroutine calls are **not**. Therefore, a subroutine called `banana` is **different** from a subroutine called `BaNaNa`.

## Subroutines:

Subroutines are an abstraction at an assembly language level that allows the programmer to define certain locations in the code. Subroutines must be suffixed with a `:`, and they can contain any lower and uppercase levels, as well as underscores, and they can begin with underscores and have as many as the programmer desires.

When a subroutine is called with either the `jz @subroutine` or `jge @subroutine` instructions, the subroutine will be replaced with the actual memory address of the subroutine in the code.

When a subroutine is jumped to, the memory address for the current location is pushed onto the call stack, and when a `ret` instruction is received to return from a subroutine, the value on the top of the stack is popped off and into the program counter.

### Note:

The value at the top of the stack may not always be the most recent jump, and the value at the top of the stack can be saved immediately after a jump by popping that value into a register. `r4` and `r5` are typically used to store the value.

## Assembler directives

The BELLE assembler has a `#include` directive, similar to C/C++, where the user can **specify a file to include to the top** of the file, allowing for projects to be split across multiple directories and many files.



The assembler will **only read the include directive from the main file that is to be assembled**, and once a line after the first line is no longer an `#include`, the assembler will stop trying to look for the directive, and simply throw an error if an `#include` is found.


## CPU directives


The BELLE-ISA allows for **parts of the CPU to be adjusted based on certain directives that it receives**. The parts that it changes are only changed when the program is loaded into memory, and at **runtime the changes will not be made**.

| Directive | Property changed | Description | Example |
| :----     | :----            | :----:      | :-----  |
| `.ssp`    | Stack pointer    | `.ssp` (Set Stack Pointer) changes the stack pointer's initial value | `.ssp $100` |
| `.sbp`    | Base pointer    | `.sbp` (Set Base Pointer) changes the base pointer's initial value | `.sbp $100` |


# Errors and debugging

## Error emission reasons


The assembler is *very* lenient with arguments passed to each operation (ADD can take subroutines as arguments, JZ can take register values, etc.), however, it can **still emit an error**.


If the code passed to the assembler **contains an error, it will stop assembling**, emit the error, and exit.


The following is a list of possible reasons for the assembler to emit an error.
 - A register value is **too big**
 - A **non-valid syntactical** token is found
 - A subroutine that is being called is **not present in the code**
 - An invalid instruction is **found in the code**
 - A memory address is **too large** (physically cannot be encoded into 16-bit instructions)
 - A literal value is **too large**
 - An instruction that doesn't have the correct amount of arguments

## Debugging source code


The assembler may emit an error **depending on whether or not the code's syntax is valid**. Refer to [docs/isa](https://github.com/BlueGummi/belle/tree/master/docs/isa) to view the **ISA and syntax** for the assembly code.


If the error happened at the syntax symbol and **token validation stage** (the lexer), the assembler will also print a red carrot (^) pointing to the **location of the error** in the line that contained an error.


The assembler will only emit **one error** (for brevity's sake) and will emit the first one it sees.


Passing **certain flags to the assembler**, such as `-d` or `-v` will emit different output.


The `-d` flag will display the entire process of **assembling source code**, and will show every token that the **assembler lexes from the input file**. The `-v` flag will create verbose output, **allowing examination of the binary output** for every line, if interested.


The assembler can also emit tips for any **instance of invalid syntax**, and a bug report/issue/PR can be opened if an idea for better tip messages comes to mind for certain errors.

## Inspecting output

On most operating systems, there is a utility known as `xxd` that can be utilized to view the contents of a binary file in binary form. `xxd -b <binary>` can be executed to view the binary of the code, and `xxd -b -c 2 <binary>` can be used to view the binary, 16 bits per row (as the instruction length is fixed to 16 bits).

## Re-assembling binary

There is a utility in the BELLE program set known as `bdump`, which is the BELLE disassembler. `bdump` can be called with a binary name to emit the original assembly code. Do note that subroutines will not exist in the diassembled code, as all subroutine calls are simply replaced with memory addresses, and there is no way to make `basm` emit binaries that contain subroutines that can be then disassembled.

# Technical details

## The pipeline

The assembler follows a pipeline to emit the binary code. First, the code is read for `#include` directives.

Then, the assembler makes one pass of the code to identify subroutines, and appending them to a global map of subroutines with their respective memory addresses.

Once this is completed, the assembler makes one last pass of the code to assemble the source code, and subroutines are replaced with their respective memory addresses
